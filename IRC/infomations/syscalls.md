| function | disc | arg|
|-|-| 
|[socket()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html)|**socket**() creates an endpoint for communication and returns a file descriptor that refers to that endpoint.|
|[setsockopt()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setsockopt.3p.html)| The _setsockopt_() function shall set the option specified by the _option_name_ argument, at the protocol level specified by the _level_ argument, to the value pointed to by the _option_value_ argument for the socket associated with the file descriptor specified by the _socket_ argument.|
|[listen()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listen.2.html) | **listen**() marks the socket referred to by _sockfd_ as a passive socket, that is, as a socket that will be used to accept incoming connection requests using [accept(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/accept.2.html).  The _backlog_ argument defines the maximum length to which the queue of pending connections for _sockfd_ may grow.  If a connection request arrives when the queue is full, the client may receive an error with an indication of **ECONNREFUSED** or, if the underlying protocol supports retransmission, the request may be ignored so that a later reattempt at connection succeeds.
|[getaddrinfo()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getaddrinfo.3.html)|Given _node_ and _service_, which identify an Internet host and a service, **getaddrinfo**() returns one or more _addrinfo_ structures, each of which contains an Internet address that can be specified in a call to [bind(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html) or [connect(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/connect.2.html).|
|[getnameinfo()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getnameinfo.3.html)|The **getnameinfo**() function is the inverse of [getaddrinfo(3)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getaddrinfo.3.html): it converts a socket address to a corresponding host and service, in a protocol-independent manner.|
|[getsockname()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getsockname.2.html)|  **getsockname**() returns the current address to which the socket _sockfd_ is bound, in the buffer pointed to by _addr_.  The _addrlen_ argument should be initialized to indicate the amount of space (in bytes) pointed to by _addr_.  On return it contains the actual size of the socket address.  The returned address is truncated if the buffer provided is too small; in this case, _addrlen_ will return a value greater than was supplied to the call.|
